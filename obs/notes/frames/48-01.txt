  * **perfect** - That is, "exactly as it should be" to accomplish all that God intended for it.
  * **There was no sin** - For some languages it is not possible to express "sin" as a thing, rather it is an action. In those cases this could be translated as, "No one ever sinned" or, "People did not sin" or, "Nothing evil had happened."
